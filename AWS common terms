Here's a dictionary of common terms related to Amazon Web Services (AWS):

Amazon Web Services (AWS): A comprehensive cloud computing platform provided by Amazon that offers a wide range of services including computing power, storage, databases, machine learning, and more.

Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2): A service that provides virtual servers in the cloud, allowing you to run applications and services on Amazon's infrastructure.

Simple Storage Service (S3): A scalable object storage service that allows you to store and retrieve data from anywhere on the web. It is commonly used for backup, archiving, content distribution, and data storage for web applications.

Relational Database Service (RDS): A managed database service that supports several popular relational database engines such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server.

Lambda: A serverless computing service that lets you run your code without provisioning or managing servers. It allows you to execute code in response to events and automatically scales based on demand.

Virtual Private Cloud (VPC): A logically isolated section of the AWS cloud where you can launch resources like EC2 instances, databases, and load balancers. It provides control over your virtual networking environment.

Elastic Load Balancer (ELB): A service that automatically distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances, enhancing the availability and fault tolerance of your applications.

Identity and Access Management (IAM): A service that helps you control access to AWS resources by providing authentication and authorization mechanisms. It allows you to create and manage users, groups, roles, and permissions.

Auto Scaling: A feature that automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances in a group based on predefined conditions, ensuring optimal performance and cost efficiency.

CloudFormation: A service that enables you to define and manage infrastructure as code using templates. It allows you to provision and update AWS resources in a predictable and automated manner.

Simple Queue Service (SQS): A fully managed message queuing service that enables you to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications.

Amazon RDS Aurora: A relational database engine compatible with MySQL and PostgreSQL, designed for high performance, scalability, and durability. It is a part of Amazon RDS.

Amazon S3 Glacier: An archival storage service for long-term data retention. It provides secure, durable, and low-cost storage for data that is infrequently accessed.

AWS CloudTrail: A service that provides governance, compliance, and auditing capabilities for your AWS account. It logs and monitors API activity, allowing you to track changes and troubleshoot issues.

AWS CloudWatch: A monitoring and observability service that provides insights into your AWS resources and applications. It allows you to collect and track metrics, monitor log files, and set alarms.

Route 53: A scalable domain name system (DNS) web service that translates domain names into IP addresses, allowing you to route traffic to your resources, such as web applications or load balancers.

Amazon Elastic Beanstalk: A fully managed service that makes it easy to deploy, run, and scale applications written in popular languages (such as Java, .NET, Node.js, Python, etc.) on AWS. It handles the underlying infrastructure for you.

AWS Lambda Layers: A distribution mechanism for libraries, custom runtimes, and other function dependencies in AWS Lambda. Layers allow you to manage and share common code across multiple functions.

Amazon DynamoDB: A fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability. It is a key-value and document database that can handle large amounts of data and high traffic loads.

Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS): A highly scalable and fully managed container orchestration service that allows you to run, scale, and manage Docker containers on AWS. It integrates with other AWS services like EC2, ECR, and IAM.

AWS Elastic Beanstalk: A service that allows you to deploy and manage applications quickly and easily, handling infrastructure provisioning, deployment, and monitoring. It supports various languages and platforms.

Amazon CloudFront: A content delivery network (CDN) service that accelerates the delivery of your website content, videos, and APIs to users worldwide. It caches and serves your content from edge locations closest to the user.

AWS Elastic Load Balancing (ELB): A service that automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets (such as EC2 instances, containers, or IP addresses) to improve availability and fault tolerance.

AWS Glue: A fully managed extract, transform, and load (ETL) service that makes it easy to prepare and load data for analytics. It automates data discovery, cataloging, and schema inference.

AWS CloudFormation: A service that allows you to create and manage a collection of AWS resources using templates. It simplifies infrastructure deployment and helps you maintain consistent configurations.

Amazon Redshift: A fully managed data warehousing service that allows you to analyze large volumes of data using SQL queries. It is optimized for online analytical processing (OLAP) and provides high performance at scale.

AWS Kinesis: A platform for real-time streaming data processing. It allows you to ingest, process, and analyze streaming data from various sources like websites, IoT devices, application logs, and more.

Amazon Aurora Serverless: An on-demand, auto-scaling configuration for Amazon Aurora (compatible with MySQL and PostgreSQL). It automatically scales database capacity based on demand, providing cost savings for intermittent workloads.

AWS Step Functions: A serverless workflow service that allows you to coordinate and visualize multiple AWS services as a series of steps in a workflow. It simplifies the development and management of applications with distributed components.

AWS Batch: A fully managed service that enables you to run batch computing workloads on the AWS cloud. It dynamically provisions resources to optimize performance and cost for your batch jobs.
