Something about AWS
What is Cloud computing?
=> Cloud computing refers to the practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the internet to store, manage, and process data instead of a local server or a personal computer. It provides users with access to computing resources and services, including data storage, software applications, and processing power, without having to invest in costly infrastructure and maintenance.

In cloud computing, users can access these resources and services on-demand through the internet, using a web browser or an application interface. This allows users to scale up or down their usage of resources based on their needs, and pay only for what they use, which makes it a cost-effective and flexible solution.

There are three main types of cloud computing services: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). IaaS provides virtualized computing resources such as servers, storage, and networking. PaaS provides a platform for developers to build, test, and deploy applications. SaaS provides software applications that are hosted and managed by a third-party provider and accessed over the internet.
